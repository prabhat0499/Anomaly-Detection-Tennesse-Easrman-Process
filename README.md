Tennesee Eastman Process is an industrial process widely used as a benchmark in test fault diagnosis and process control.

# Case Studies:
* Plant Wide Control
* Statistical Process Monitoring
* Sensor fault detection
* Identification of data-driven models.


# Aim and Objective of the Project:

Our Aim: To predict correct Fault between 1 to 20 as possible with high precision.

#### Incorrect Fault detection will impact the cost of maintenance and waste worker's time in resolving incorrect fault.

Some Basic information to know:
Anomaly means something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected.

## Outline of the Project:
* Data Preprocessing
* EDA
* Feature Selection and Feature Engineering
* Model Building
* Hyperparameter Optimization
* Accuracy Check
